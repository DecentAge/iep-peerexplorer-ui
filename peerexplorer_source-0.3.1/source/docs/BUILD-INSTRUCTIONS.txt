Build Instructions Infinity Peerexplorer v0.3.1
----------------------------------------

XIN Peerexplorer makes extensive use of nodejs. We use if for dependency managemnt, 
to power our builds and to assist in development through auto-recompiling and to 
power up your local development server. Complete installation instructions for nodejs 
are out of the scope of this document since those instructions depend largely on the 
platform you are on.
